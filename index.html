          Draw of my feelings, my roam, heart pain, anger, confusion about life,
          and the future while I do not have anywhere to settle, motivated me to
          put my feelings on paper! and I named it (sadness of dispersion), each
          time, my pen was touching the paper I left a bunch of my pain on the
          paper. The second one was a woman who is by herself and tries to carry
          her baby to a new country to fine peace and move from evil to an
          unclear path with lots of hesitation and, stress.I called this one
          (life path). The third one was a drawing of a deer mom and her child
          with the deepest meaningful eyes, she was protecting her child. I had
          missed my mom so much to put my head on her arm to tell her how much I
          missed her so, I called it (the mother). Then it was almost depressed
          me and so lonely who was listening to music a lot, all the time
          setting on the bed and thinking, crying, and listening to music,
          everywhere was music, it was in my hair, my feet, my hands, and
          fingers I called the this one (the Music). It was December first, 2021
          when I got a flight from UAE, Abu Dhabi, the Humanitarian city
          compound to Fort Dix military compound in New Jersey, US. I felt
          better but still I was depressed, I was homesick so I talked to God
          and trust him and think about hope for the new future that was coming
          to me, about new life and dreams so, I created the (trust). The last
          one was some days before leaving the military compound I finished the
          last one and I called it (happiness).
